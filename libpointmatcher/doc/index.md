Tutorials
=========

This page lists the available tutorials for libpointmatcher. The [Beginner Section](#beginner) is aimed at the more casual user and contains high-level information on the various steps of point cloud registration. The [Advanced Section](#advanced) is targeted at those with existing experience with point cloud registration and proficiency in C++ development.  Those who wish to contribute to libpointmatcher can follow the guidelines in the [Developer](#developer) section.
